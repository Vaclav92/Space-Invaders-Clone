# Space-Invaders-Clone
A clone of Space Invaders written in Python. You (The player) control a ship, moving side to side, shoot aliens.
This is a project from Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes.
This project is really cool! It shows how to utilize multiple modules, classes, methods and bringing an image to the screen.
I had fun creating it. I learned a lot from this and you can too.
